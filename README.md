## Fruit supply chain
Made entirely for learning purposes.

It is an implementation of a simple fruit supply chain where fruit shipments can be tracked from the moment they are gathered by farmers
until they reach customers with a help of distributors.

It also implements an ERC20 token called MangoToken which doesn't do anything for now.
